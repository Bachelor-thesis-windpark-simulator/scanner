# README

Project for the course "Geoinformatics 8: Perspectives" at the ifgi MÃ¼nster.
Based mainly upon [CityScoPy](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_CityScoPy)

Currently only working on Linux machines.

## How to use
Before starting the containers check the mounted video devices with `ls /dev | grep video` and adjust the docker-compose files according to your system and set the correct cameraID for the camera you want to use in cityscopy.json  


1. Run `xhost +local:docker`
2. If a new camera is used run `docker compose -f docker-compose.calibrate.yml up` and select the corners of the grid. The run `docker compose -f docker-compose.calibrate.yml down`
3. Run `docker compose up`
4. To stop the application do a keyboard interrupt and run `docker compose down`


## Documentation dockerfile
The base python:3.8-bullseye was chosen due to the good compatibilty with the used python packages.  
Only one RUN statement was used to avoid unecessary layers. in the RUN statement all necessary dependencies are installed and a non-root user is created. The user is part of the video group so that the container can use cameras.  
Afte ther RUN statement the user is changed from the root user to the newly created user.

## To Do's

[ ] (Maybe) Automate the device mounting. See [stackoverflow: docker-compose devices map all devices from local to container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73339141/docker-compose-devices-map-all-devices-from-local-to-container)  
[ ] Connect to a CityIO instance instead the local udp listener   
[ ] Test and adjust with a real grid
